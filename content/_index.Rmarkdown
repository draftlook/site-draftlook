Welcome to the personal website of [@DraftLook](https://twitter.com/draftlook). The current purpose of this page is to host my NHL Draft Rankings, which have now outgrown Wordpress and Substack. My apologies to those signed up for my [Substack newsletter](https://draftlookhockey.substack.com) who are now having me switch things up on them a little bit; I'll be sure to send an email out to all of you notifying you of any new content on this page. Potentially, I could expand this site to host other content like in-depth [player breakdowns](https://draftlookhockey.substack.com/p/simon-edvinsson). However, I'm quite happy with Substack as the location for those right now and see no need to get too fancy unless I have a real reason to make a switch. For these rankings, the increased customization and automation of the process is that reason. For breakdowns: I don't have one.

This is a site thrown together using [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.org)'s [XMin](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin) Hugo theme, constructed via RStudio's [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package for RMarkdown site creation and hosted with Github Pages. It's not the absolute prettiest thing you'll ever see, but I needed a platform that would allow me full customization over the HTML and CSS of a page. I chose the bare-bones XMin theme to keep things simple for myself and avoid conflict between the theme CSS (written by the creator of the theme) and the page's CSS (written poorly by myself). Depending on the extent of which I make use of this website beyond my rankings, I may attempt to spruce things up a little at some point.
