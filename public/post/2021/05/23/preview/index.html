<!-- One Thing I Love -->
<hr class="break" style="border:1px solid black">
</hr>
<p><strong>One Thing I Love</strong>: Pastujov is deceptively skilled; I don’t think his tools really stand out to many as top-level, but he dominated the NTDP’s competition through excellent habits and deceiving ability. Most important for him, I think, was his ability to make plays under pressure with a defender in his space– Pastujov’s capacity to find a continuation play and maintain possession for his team in situations where a lot of players would turn the puck over ended in points for him quite frequently.
<br>
<img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/5fdkALa27PNrmtl8G_zvGqHO051zhdiPx9JOh0SO0NN8lj28c2hPSxc5gKFyIUZaVhpY5HeoeX6Ecg5s5PazEr1mXSO3s0bJY-3jky63NXM_qlNiZVQwrqBUsfDV6YMze8mL1cid" /><!-- -->
<br>
Very similar: hips in front, defender can’t make a play on the puck, quick backhand pass to a teammate. This time, Pastujov gets to bang in the rebound.
<br>
<img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ZU1GNVXhrsWOM-pyqLyN0VHVzAHS6RBgmg7omnhdkPZ7uStZMeV2P7lPdjfSGa2LIBtOJpMezdxvSVM5XCksArB1WatGFgtiao0s7kYf_-lsuyYW_9hLYz5Bc--pNGQaBHTSpnvy" /><!-- -->
<br>
I wanted to include a really good solo effort clip in here to highlight that Pastujov does have high-end skill, it just isn’t as consistently visible as with some other prospects. Still also a nice habit play here: after beating defender #1 wide, he takes a step or two inside to get his body in front and prevent that defender from taking any last-second chops at his stick.
<br>
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Jv_PCCBLXb7Nv8g9p8b2oE3d7ABmJcA2GIOy6DRfT3eg_hVh9xi31AMYX4seOotflyBqJmuZGPIFtiY3MXjdDr-4GD-T8s5KgmRpkNbcwTlulKUlkf63FZjMa5HxTYJJYdpiLLyM" /><!-- -->
<br>
This one-hand pass to bypass the last line of defence creates an easy tap-in goal for Pastujov.
<br>
<img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/nLUgGO3X4pqab_1cIo3R_bKPdCTW1y6ccst4vhKBz8up9M9VfgU0INDiJmOXakKsz3JHNol230pqLGpLPtLeFIwD3B8jKacSjeGDmUvpJRiy4sMkh7Ox2KJTMSeGQXhfMq8A3p6o" /><!-- -->
<br></p>
<!-- Another Thing I Love -->
<p><strong>Another Thing I Love:</strong> Here’s another really useful habit. Pastujov has a very keen eye for passing lanes, understanding that making yourself an option is more than just blindly driving the net. He sees passing lanes and understands that he’s only an option when he’s at the end of one. Look at him delay here, sitting out in space and waiting for that lane to open up.
<br>
<img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_aNPux_tkHFQkjIPL9Oe1Nf7vroZ4QHqs2L9yl5JhlTvsJDOO8K2zP3SbJOI5p6Fqgz6LkXnPBdDoA9PP_iDL-6K-Wm39BnLHSIqeDHwGiwPvxNkpH4f4vGRU3kiJaHNvI2YxfYl" /><!-- -->
<br>
Similar here. He’s in no rush to get right to the net; his understanding of playmaking is more nuanced than that. It works for him.
<br>
<img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/8vTUv09VdMJKEkIkP9umMUp0lqfxG0eB5PqhTiV8IUyZzpEcW0HssYXTcTyGUjlsR2z-yAN8STBuZ1-YEG3NbwdD2Xgt6zxAKOKE3rt0XfuGHeH1VRk61nj62LxOXJGUtn9Uxh2w" /><!-- -->
<br>
Sitting in line with the back post, hoping for a pass across. When the lane opens up, it’s just one quick stride to get on the end of it while keeping his body open to the passer.
<br>
<img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/uXhf8HztDPEN-SYpv5gisUVzLbyhoU9s1Wqv74m9IR8nDCJgUJumJxDMZoC0I3HldaUJ0d2KGzpxd04xzOkmkg6ZcjkllrELrelwchH-Sk7OvDkssXaDumlk3z6xpnBrn3p-J-H8" /><!-- -->
<br>
Watch Pastujov fight for stick position with the backdoor defender, getting body position and basically rendering his checker irrelevant.
<br>
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9iaHTdlYf-UOKgUAe3oPd8NuhpxzCYMzqpZL-i0mJmTYUTyatkVBYmbJ-zxgqy_ujyU4k1WoWsf56b_TOezbzGPYmP0rgTpXmGbqkLQPLhjLvPg1LgzfW1uswND6ISncc3Is_UFj" /><!-- -->
<br>
Slips behind the defender (who ends up a little lost, that’s how you exploit a defender not facing his assignment), remains squared to the puck until he gets this pass, then pivots to face the net and finishes.
<br>
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pGcMtYQjDsYqXY6aKepe74DTVyMuElD1N-k0wgxyIYG0OZO4sHqvky4hk_GvrKwO2j9cbGCn2mR8rIHpr90JbD1Clj4k38VXend8hHC_qaNCTlBRf_B7bV61SQeOPoTYP_eQ914z" /><!-- -->
<br></p>
<!-- Swing Skill -->
<p><strong>Swing Skill:</strong> Pastujov isn’t a great skater, lacking explosiveness and any sort of threatening speed off the rush. He seems to recognize this, rarely trying to beat the defence with speed. He really doesn’t try to gain speed with the purpose of using it against the defence here.
<br>
<img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/PO17BzGDa4hKCwdjiPa-8nUivfTmB-3L3F60eswPSZmkiwO9FMNfuV8IWVwSCd4LPriUH8IC6sI1a7eSbsgispj3gr5whMnvhzIuhPkxM7nNAFXcrZZKUp2et0wg0Jz1J5QljcVp" /><!-- -->
<br>
And he quickly has to abort this attempt to move down the wall after failing to create any type of separation whatsoever.
<br>
<img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Pao19RSphbcuL70I8K7oVFZ_J0H7tn8b7csRUvdZVK4hruwUToej9Jsy1zr5tOJB6YpD8ao6bBhfuBpx9ClFNSt6whWKaUSzjXiiyILTlmdalzVnrBEwYiaRux9z589MllRmgzV-" /><!-- -->
<br>
Respect to Sasha for believing in himself, but I don’t think he has much of a chance at beating many defenders to the outside like this. Looks like it ends a little painfully for him too.
<br>
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/dA5GiqCMBjvJelqbXJu3x9VvL63cx-rIZ2LFwado9Z9TKPZkTy0BISAQw8061CkFeBI_yIOm7jPQXtiGHy5jb6pFUpAa5R_5KYMVJ-vSApiVp6UfPkZwT9lO3E4Sd6kJ0_UUcvMD" /><!-- -->
<br>
Instead, Pastujov uses east-west motion, deception, puck skills, and intelligent passes to beat defenders off the rush.
<br>

<br></p>
<!-- Development -->
<p><strong>Development:</strong> Ideally, Pastujov would be able to at least partially threaten with his skating as a method of complementing his slower, more creative methods of rush creation. The reason why he’s been so successful with the USNTDP is that he’s already managed to identify a variety of methods to produce offence in ways that aren’t reliant on speed, and that’s really because of his exceptional creativity and intelligence. If you’re gonna have a player with mobility concerns, that’s exactly what you’d hope they would possess to mitigate that issue. Still though– it’ll be harder to exploit NHL defenders with passes into space, sneaky puck moves, and some of the other ways Pastujov found success creating offence against majority-USHL defenders (who generally aren’t particularly good at the whole defence thing). Without speed improvement, becoming a consistent offensive contributor could be quite the uphill battle for Pastujov. I find that his stride is rather fluid and doesn’t look too bad, but he’s not creating much power with each push-off. Leg extension seems to be the most visible issue; it’s apparent even from a full-speed clip that Pastujov isn’t driving that leg down and through the ice, with a full extension behind, like he should.
<br>
<img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/PO17BzGDa4hKCwdjiPa-8nUivfTmB-3L3F60eswPSZmkiwO9FMNfuV8IWVwSCd4LPriUH8IC6sI1a7eSbsgispj3gr5whMnvhzIuhPkxM7nNAFXcrZZKUp2et0wg0Jz1J5QljcVp" /><!-- -->
<br>
This is the extent of the leg extension from that sequence.
<br>
<img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/j4nSTndMh0R8sNhxVXI6Rrowtr0egszaqPPinkif9u3zoCOgl1Dxmf_wxvazJSJnUbAIpeTQhIxSGvoRdmQWwgcX76nqTAnWUsWMo9VUtqvT1okDtzAMY0efk6xrEqgI0s-cqSvS" /><!-- -->
<br>
Also– linear crossovers! Any time you’re skating in open ice it should be crossover after crossover. It’s by far the most efficient way to gather speed moving up ice.
<br></p>
<!-- Projection -->
<p><strong>Projection:</strong>
<br>
<em>Top-end:</em> Top-line winger that makes major strides as a skater (ha) while continuing to show high-level creativity, deception, and intelligent habits on a regular basis. He’s an upside guy– he has a lot of skill, it doesn’t always shine through in the most visible ways, but better skating could tie it all together into a major value package.
<br>
<em>Mid-level:</em> Middle-six winger whose rush productivity takes a hit against better defenders, but should still be a real smart player that makes under-the-radar plays to contribute offensively. Could be a sneaky point producer just like he is now.
<br>
<em>Low-end:</em> Fizzles out somewhere in the transition from NCAA to AHL at some point due to mobility issues and an inability to play fast off the rush.</p>
