<p>Welcome to the personal website of <a href="https://twitter.com/draftlook">@DraftLook</a>. The current purpose of this page is to host my NHL Draft Rankings, which have now outgrown Wordpress and Substack. My apologies to those signed up for my <a href="https://draftlookhockey.substack.com">Substack newsletter</a> who are now having me switch things up on them a little bit; I&rsquo;ll be sure to send an email out to all of you notifying you of any new content on this page. Potentially, I could expand this site to host other content like in-depth <a href="https://draftlookhockey.substack.com/p/simon-edvinsson">player breakdowns</a>. However, I&rsquo;m quite happy with Substack as the location for those right now and see no need to get too fancy unless I have a real reason to make a switch. For these rankings, the increased customization and automation of the process is that reason. For breakdowns: I don&rsquo;t have one.</p>
<p>This is a site thrown together using <a href="https://yihui.org">Yihui Xie</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin">XMin</a> Hugo theme, constructed via RStudio&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown">blogdown</a> package for RMarkdown site creation and hosted with Github Pages. It&rsquo;s not the absolute prettiest thing you&rsquo;ll ever see, but I needed a platform that would allow me full customization over the HTML and CSS of a page. I chose the bare-bones XMin theme to keep things simple for myself and avoid conflict between the theme CSS (written by the creator of the theme) and the page&rsquo;s CSS (written poorly by myself). Depending on the extent of which I make use of this website beyond my rankings, I may attempt to spruce things up a little at some point.</p>
